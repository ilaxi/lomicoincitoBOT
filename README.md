LomicoincitoBOT is a simple Discord economy bot. It is still under development and many features remain to be
added. Development is currently on hold due to prioritizing other projects. The current version (0.5) is fully
implemented, with many more features planned for the future.

At the moment, the bot has a fully implemented time-based economy system and 14 active, functional commands
These commands cover everything from player information—such as level, profile, and economic statistics—to
economy functions like requesting coins at certain intervals, collecting a daily reward every 24 hours, buying
items, and more.

Additionally, it includes 2 gambling games, with plans to add many more, along with several other commands that
provide significant flexibility.
